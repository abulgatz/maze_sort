This takes an image of a maze as input and solves it using BFS and DFS

Notes:

* Image must be in RGB, *not indexed* mode
* Maze must be surrounded by black border, or the solver will attempt to go off of the edge of the maze and you will get an index out of bounds error
* Start and end must be stated explicitly in (X,Y) coordinates. Top left of image is (0,0)
